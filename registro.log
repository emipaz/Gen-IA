that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.

Welcome to a skills certificate for generative AI for software development. It's
an innovative course designed to empower you with the cutting edge skills
required to integrate and leverage generative artificial intelligence within the
realm of software development. As businesses and technologies evolve, the demand
for advanced AI capabilities is skyrocketing. This course offers you a
comprehensive pathway to not only understand generative AI technologies, but
also to apply them when you create, enhance, and scale software applications. By
the end of this specialization, you'll know how to use generative AI tools to
assist you with all of the major tasks that make up the software developer role,
allowing you to do your work better and more efficiently. You may have heard
about how GenAI can generate code, but you need a lot more than just code to
build a working system. So with this course, you'll see how you can enhance your
coding skills to become a better engineer by having large language models, or
LLMs, at your side to assist you through the process. So let's begin by taking a
step back and exploring LLMs. You might have heard these terms, but what do they
really mean for you as a developer? Let's unpack this and explore the
implications for your projects and workflows. Generative AI refers to artificial
intelligence systems that can generate new content. This includes everything
from code snippets to fully rendered images, and even synthetic media like
videos and music. For instance, you may have encountered tools like GitHub
Copilot. It's a prime example of how generative AI assists in coding by
suggesting entire lines or blocks of code as you type. It's fascinating to see
how deeply AI is integrated into the tools that you use daily. Think about
search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs, and even some debugging tools, all
powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency. Focusing on the generative side, AI
can now aid in content creation that

Let's start your journey by going back to basics and looking at the AI
landscape. I'm assuming if you're taking this course, you're an experienced
developer, but you may not know as much about machine learning or generative AI.
The next few videos will provide a high level overview of the way machine
learning models are trained using data. I'll also explain how one architectural
called a transformer is particularly well suited for powering large language
models. If you already are comfortable with these topics, feel free to scam or
even skip the next few videos in this module. If not, stick with me for a quick
introduction to the key concepts, powering generative AI tools. There are many
definitions of AI, but the one that I prefer is to think of AI as programming a
computer to react to data in the way an intelligent being does. Let's explore
what that means. Here's an image of a cat. You know it's a cat? I know it's a
cat. But how would a computer see this? A computer doesn't really see, and
instead, it would recognize this picture as just a bunch of colored pixels that
have no associated meaning. Whereas you and I would see a cat, and a different
thinking being like a dog would also see it as a cat and probably react by
chasing it or barking at it. But how do living creatures see the cats? We don't
see pixels, but instead we see something like eyes and ears and paws and the
like, and over time, we have learned that when a creature has ears like this and
eyes like this, it's a cat. Does this give us the basis to program a computer to
be artificially intelligent in the way that living creatures are really
intelligent? The answer is, yes. Remember the definition from a few moments ago,
it's that the concept of AI is programming a computer to react to data. If you
can have the computer recognize features in the same way that people or animals
do and learn to put these features together to make an interpretation that what
it's looking at is a cat, then you can say that

the technology is and staying with the technology even as it matures, I think
that would be critical for us really doing the best work that we can. >>
Sometimes when we start building a system, we start at the whiteboard and we
start drawing all these boxes and arrows between them and thinking about the
constraints. And given the idea that today we generate code or we generate
documentation, or we generate test cases and other things from a prompt. It
might be very interesting that in the not-too-distant future, those system
specification designs that we draw on boxes on a whiteboard could be the next
prompt. And to be able to design systems off of those with multimodal models now
being able to recognize imagery and being able to parse that kind of thing. That
I can see that going back to that domain expertise, that when you have a domain
expertise to solve a particular problem and you can draw the architecture of
that, that architecture can be implicitly turned into code which would execute.
And you may not even be interfacing that much with raw code, right, unless you
want to tweak and debug. And it's like five years from now, that could be a way
that software developers will be even more effective. And it's something that
I'm looking forward to, that's in the future. But what do we have today? So in
this specialization, so we have three courses. The first thing that we do want
to emphasize that this isn't a series of courses on how to build generative AI.
This is a series of courses on how to use generative AI to be a better software
developer. And the skills that we're looking at building here are really
relevant for you in all areas. As we've touched on a little bit already, it's
not just coding, it's documentation, dependency management, testing, a little
bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your friend. >> So
with these courses, anyone that writes code, we're going to adopt best practices

Welcome to Generative AI for Software Development. Generative AI is helping many
software developers write faster, better codes. And just to be clear, this
specialization is not about writing generative AI applications. It's about how
generative AI can help with software development, whether you're data scientists
or front end or backend or full stack of mobile or whatever type of developer.
I'm here with Laurence Moroney, who will be instructor for these courses. You
might be familiar with Laurence from the Tensorflow courses he had taught with
Deep Learn AI some time back. Laurence is also the author of more than 30 books,
some Sci-Fi some programming, many machine learning. And I'm excited to have him
teach best practices for how you can write software better using generative AI.
>> Always delighted to be here, Andrew, and to work alongside you and your team.
So one of the things that I know you've been thinking about is really the impact
of Generative AI on the day to day role of a software developer. And how do you
feel it's going to impact, what's that going to look like? >> The thing that
surprised me was how much more fun coding is with generative AI than without.
Three weeks ago, I was trying to deploy something to cloud service. Hadn't done
it for a while and I'd forgotten how to do it. And I thought, boy, if I had to
go and read that documentation to figure it out, I could have done it. But
frankly, it was much faster to prompt an LLM to guide me through the sense,
which turned out to be almost correct. To help me package up a Docker container,
push to the cloud service they're using, and just get the job done. So I find
myself looking forward to coding more now that I know I have this coding
companion as my generative AI buddy to help me along. >> Yeah, it's those kind
of drudgery tasks sometimes that take away from the joy of solving a particular
problem. And when you have that pair programmer

Now let's dive into the engine room of modern AI specifically the transformer
architecture. This revolutionary design has become a game changer for natural
language processing. You'll unpack the basics of how transformers work, see how
they've paved the way for the advanced large language models like GPT or Gemini
that have so quickly captured public attention and started to revolutionize what
it looks like to be a software developer. First introduced in the paper,
Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al in 2017. The transformer model
brought a new approach to machine learning models for handling sequences of
information like text. Earlier you saw how supervised learning worked. A
computer learns to predict data that was labeled, and a machine learned to match
the data to the label, like a retina to a doctor's opinion of the state of
disease within that retina. More complex algorithms such as recurrent neural
networks, started to learn about the sequences of data. Now, this was really
useful for models that could predict what would happen next in a system as
opposed to predicting what they see. For text, these could be pretty good, but
they were limited in understanding the deep meaning in text. The big idea behind
transformers is that they process all parts of the data simultaneously. This
parallel processing capability not only speeds up training, but also improves
the ability to handle long range dependencies in text. Now, let's take a look
and see what this means. Consider this sentence. In Ireland, I went to secondary
school, so I had to study blank. How would you finish this sentence? Let's
explore that a little bit. First, secondary school is the equivalent to high
school elsewhere. It's for older children studying more advanced things. Of
course, Ireland is a country, so there may be topics that someone would study in
Ireland, that people in other countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis
on that country in the sentence, instead of just saying,

little bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your
friend. >> So with these courses, anyone that writes code, we're going to adopt
best practices and using generative AI to help with these. Can you say a bit
more about what the three courses are about? >> Sure, sure, so we kind of broke
the three courses into themes. So the first course is really for you as an
individual software developer. It's going to introduce you a little bit to LLMs
and how you can use them as a pair programmer. But then you're going to get into
prompting and system prompting and having an LLM play roles like software tester
or any of those kind of roles of the type of people that you'd be working
alongside to build better code. The second one then is really when you start
thinking about collaboration with other people as a software engineer. You're
going to work with testers, you're going to work with people who do
documentation, you're going to be working with people who give you dependencies.
They may be internal to your company, or it might be third party dependencies
like Python ones. And we're going to work through the skills of you being able
to use an LLM to just be better at doing all of that. Then in the third and
final course, it's like we're really going to take that to the professional
software developer level where you can understand the full workflow of building
and launching applications from the design phase with design patterns and the
famous gang of four patterns through things like data serialization and database
management. That's really the whole idea of this, to help you start as an
individual developer, go on to working in a team, and then go on to really being
able to deploy professional solutions. >> And do these courses have any
prerequisites? >> I think the only prerequisite here would be it's good to know
a little bit of python. So if you're a Python developer,

countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis on that country in the
sentence, instead of just saying, I had to study. As a human, you paid attention
to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you to predict that
the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the language, and you'll
be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that presented transformers.
Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers are highly
technical, and I'm not going to go into all of the specifics here. That would be
a full course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are
important for you to know. Let's go on to the next video to explore those
concepts.

to each other in the text. LLMs available to you will have been trained on
almost unfathomably large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This
training allows them both to understand long or nuanced prompts and generate new
text, for example, code that best matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're
excited to start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're going to learn about in the next
module. I'll see you there.

the patterns that it learned to match that data to answers to give out a
prediction or an inference about that data. So in our case of activity
detection, now someone else could take a device, and based on the pattern
matching rules that the machine learned and put into the model, it can then
detect if that person was walking, biking, running or golfing. This is one form
of machine learning, and it's called supervised learning. Let's move on to the
next video to take a closer look at supervised learning.

sentence, instead of just saying, I had to study. As a human, you paid attention
to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you to predict that
the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the language, and you'll
be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that presented transformers.
Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers are highly
technical, and I'm not going to go into all of the specifics here. That would be
a full course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are
important for you to know. Let's go on to the next video to explore those
concepts.

you sometimes get stuck. You gotta find a human expert to help you get unstuck.
And I really like this analogy of pair programming of you always have a buddy
with you now that you can ask it a question with from right away. And I think
compared to waiting a day or whatever to track down that domain expert, not that
the LLM always knows every answer. But the fact that your buddy can give you an
answer right away, give you some options, I see this helping developers get
unstuck. Not all the time, but at least much more rapidly. >> I found for me
personally, sometimes if it's not helping solve the immediate problem, it sparks
inspiration. Some of the answers that it give will help me find a different
track that I'm going to follow to be able to fix a particular problem or to go a
whole new direction that I hadn't previously thought of. And it's that sparking
of inspiration is one of the things that really can make the task more
enjoyable. >> One of the things I really appreciate about the insights you
brought to our conversations was I think a lot of us have been using generative
AI to help with coding in ad hoc but effective ways. One of the things that I
saw you do that I really appreciated was going through, frankly, a lot of the
tasks that developers have to go through. And then to think through best
practices for how can generative AI help with different tasks? So, for example,
I just had not thought of using generative AI to help with test-driven
development to write tests until I heard about that from you quite a while back
now. But I think those systematic analysis of what are the things you could do,
what are the best practices? I really appreciate your thinking that, putting it
together for us. >> Thank you, thank you. Yeah, and another one in that realm
that I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your

almost unfathomably large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This
training allows them both to understand long or nuanced prompts and generate new
text, for example, code that best matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're
excited to start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're going to learn about in the next

suffer vision loss before any diagnosis. And this is a tragedy because the
disease is completely preventable. In order to address this doctor shortage,
researchers turned to machine learning. They created a dataset of tens of
thousands of retinal scans that were graded by doctors on a five point scale
from no issues all the way up to advanced disease. Doctors would spot patterns
like hemorrhages, as you can see here. The researchers then used the resulting
data and human assigned labels to train a machine learning algorithm to match
one to the other and carry out the same feature spotting as the doctors. So this
model enables a computer to learn how to diagnose images as well as, and
sometimes even better than, a human. But machine learning can sometimes find
other interesting relationships in the data set. In this case, the retina images
weren't just labeled with disease features, but also other data like the
patient's age, their birth, assigned gender, blood pressure readings and so on.
And because supervised learning matches data to labels, the algorithm here has
learned to match the images to all of the labels, and in the process, reveals
something new. The model was able to correctly predict a person's birth,
assigned gender from the retina image 97% of the time. Somehow it could see this
label in the images in a way that humans cannot. A human will get this right
about 50% of the time, the same odds as flipping a coin. So, supervised learning
is a very powerful technique that can be applied to different kinds of labeled
data, from images to sounds and text. In fact, it's supervised learning using
text data that has led to the development of the powerful large language models
that power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are
trained on vast amounts of text data, where the model learns the relationships
between sequences of words and what naturally follows. Enabling it to predict

 Hola, soy el bot del curso Introducción al Data Engineering Módulo 1. 

La inteligencia artificial generativa (IA generativa) se refiere a sistemas de inteligencia artificial que pueden generar contenido nuevo. Esto incluye desde fragmentos de código hasta imágenes completamente renderizadas, e incluso medios sintéticos como videos y música. Por ejemplo, herramientas como GitHub Copilot son ejemplos de cómo la IA generativa asiste en la codificación al sugerir líneas o bloques completos de código mientras escribes.

La IA generativa no solo es una herramienta para crear contenido más rápido, sino que representa un cambio de paradigma en cómo se pueden abordar problemas y soluciones en el desarrollo de software. Ofrece una forma de automatizar y mejorar la creatividad, reduciendo el tiempo desde el concepto hasta el producto. Esto puede ser especialmente útil para desarrolladores de software, ya que les permite generar activos para juegos o aplicaciones directamente a partir de descripciones.

Si tienes más preguntas sobre este tema o sobre el curso, no dudes en preguntar.

You've now started experimenting with using an LLM like ChatGPT to help you be a
better coder by exploring prompting, ongoing conversations to improve code, and
using roles like expert software engineer or beginners tutor. In this module,
you're going to explore data structures, the kind that you might study in
undergraduate computer science. Now you might be thinking, what? I already
understand data structures like arrays or linked lists, and you'd be right. But
what I find exciting is how these can really help you go deeper into
understanding engineering problems, like scalability, maintainability, security,
and a whole lot more. Let's have some fun in this module, dusting off some of
our old ideas about things like link lists, trees, or graphs. But we're going to
go much deeper into building production code with an LLM by our side.

---
Fuente  : E:\ia-generative\semana_3\7_Graded lab Graph algorithms.txt
titulo :  -- 
In all the videos for this module so far, you've seen how you can work with an
LLM to implement some fundamental data structures, not just the basics from CS
101, but also how you would take these structures into the real world with
considerations for scalability, security, and having them well documented and
tested. Now I'd like you to get hands-on in the graded lab for this course. Your
task will be to implement some important algorithms for working with graphs.
I've provided a graph implementation graph.py, which you can use as your
starting point. Now you're going to have two problems to solve, and for each
you're going to solve it for two cases. First, we'll be with a small graph with
about ten nodes, and then for a large graph with thousands of nodes. The first
problem is given two vertices of a graph. I'd like you to implement an algorithm
to calculate the shortest route between them. One common solution to this is
called Dijkstra's algorithm, and you'll probably learn about others as you chat
with the LLM. The second problem is this, given a starting vertex, calculate the
shortest route to take where you're going to visit all of the vertices in the
graph. A little hint this is commonly called the travelling salesman problem,
and this often shows up in job interviews. Take some time to work on these and
test the code created by ChatGPT thoroughly as you go along. Also, think through
how you're going to make sure that the code is of professional quality and ready
for production, with attributes like security, scalability, manageability, and
so on. The lab will grade your work by running your code on some test cases.
There will also be some hints that you can consult in case you get stuck, and
hopefully the LLM will be a more useful tool as you go through the activity.
When you've completed the lab, I'll see you in the next video to discuss the
final data structure of this module. The hash table.

or something like that. Now, let's see what that looks like. Here's the prompt.
After assigning the role, you can paste the code into the context window for the
model to assess. Here, GPT writes a lengthy response covering necessary stuff
like input validation, error handling, and so on. I'll be honest. I only learned
that Python has a default recursion limit when I read this. It's typically 1,000
calls. A perfectly balanced binary search tree could conceivably hold 2^1,000
values, which is an inconceivably high number. But, of course, the deeper the
tree, the deeper the recursion stack. Again, one could potentially use insert
calls for denial of service attack. You might want to cap the Python recursion
limit. Can you figure out how to do that? I'll leave that as an exercise for
you. Now, having prompted GPT to do the expert and SRE analysis and having
gotten lots of feedback, think about how you would ask it to follow up on that
feedback. Here's a couple of examples that I did. But at this point, you should
be thinking of your own prompts and evaluating the code that comes back. Check
out this video and how I interacted with GPT to continually improve and solidify
the code, and then try it for yourself and see what you can do to improve your
own code. You can find the tree implementation code from this video, which was
created with the assistance of ChatGPT in the downloads for this course. It's
called avl.py. AVL, it's named after the inventors of this type of self-
balancing binary search tree, Georgy Adelson-Velsky, and Evgenii Landis. I hope
I pronounce their names right. Download it, test it out and see if you can break
it. There are some obvious bugs in there, so play with it, and then use an LLM
as your coding companion to help you fix those bugs. Take your time, work
through the code. You'll see that the implementation has grown far beyond our
original binary search tree, and it looks a lot more like the code that you'd
expect to find in a professional

with an LLM. Here is the response of the model. Now, your results may vary
slightly from what you see here in the video because LLMs are non-deterministic.
But you'll likely see similar topics and key points in particular for the
billions question, where the model emphasizes the need to take into account
memory and stuff like that. Python is very efficient for arrays as it stores
data in a contiguous block of memory, but whenever memory comes into question,
there are risks, so you could ask the model about those risks. What would happen
if you implemented billions of numbers using an array? What risks would you
face? You can write a prompt like this and get lots of great information back,
detailing issues like memory consumption, fragmentation, performance issues,
limited flexibility, etc. Also, maybe things like accessing my data would be
highlighted, and while an array operates in Order 1 for access, there's no easy
way to search an array. Or, as you saw in the previous module, you could assign
the model a role, and in this case, an expert software engineer, and then have
it profile your code or give you advice like this. Now, all of this interaction
with the model and the analysis it has provided, has given you a lot of
information to consider when deciding whether to use an array or not.
Ultimately, you'll make a decision based on your exact scenario. As you may
recall from Computer Science 101, some of the constraints of the array data
structure can be mitigated by implementing more complex data structures. For
example, one of the constraints of the basic array is that there's no inherent
order. You just keep adding stuff to the end of the array. If you want to order
data like sorted numbers, then to insert a new value, you're going to have to
shift everything else down to create a location to store the new value in. Or if
you want to remove an item from the array, you have to delete the item and then
shift everything else up. In an array with

locations, but a specific flight, like the 3:00 PM from Seattle to San Jose, is
a one way connection. If you were building a navigation system with time
sensitivity, you could see where your graph of locations could have both types
of connection. Or more likely, you could have multiple graphs. Graphs are an
incredibly flexible data structure, which, as you can see, can have many uses.
But how do you, as a developer, get the most out of them? Well, let's dive in
and take a look. We'll start with this code that I created using ChatGPT to
implement a directed graph. You can find it in graph.py in the course materials.
You can either use the provided code, of course, or you could write your own.
But what I want you to do next is to look at the code and consider how it might
be used in production. As before, pause the video, think about it a bit, play
with it, and then think through how this implementation might need to be changed
to make it production quality. Take some time with it and then come back when
you're done. Okay, so what did you come up with? For me, the first and most
obvious issue is the fact that the graph only gives a connection between A and
B. But that's not enough information to be useful. For navigation on a map, for
example, one might need distance. For relationships between people, one might
need type. I'm connected to my wife, children and friends, but the type of
connection is much more important between some of them than it is between
others. But the structure doesn't have that. So there are semantic issues that
we need to address. Also consider scalability. If you're using this for
locations with connections between them on a map, there may be many millions of
locations, each with many routes connecting them with other locations. This
thing would have to be able to handle huge amounts of data. And then there's the
underlying implementation. You can see that self.graph is a dictionary, but is
this data type

---
Fuente  : E:\ia-generative\semana_3\5_Trees.txt
titulo :  -- 
of how they work, but also how to scale them and make them more secure. Let's
start with trees. Whether you're refreshing your knowledge or looking to gain a
deeper understanding of tree structures, I hope this video will provide valuable
insights. Let's just grow our knowledge together. Here's a reminder of the
fundamentals. A tree is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes, which
store data connected by edges. A defining feature of a tree is that a single
node is designated as the root node, and this node forms the top of the tree.
The root node then has links to one or more child nodes. In this case, you can
see two child nodes. The child nodes can themselves have one or more children.
Any node below the root node without children is called a leaf node. Note that
there are no cycles in a tree. One of the most common types of tree is the
binary tree where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as a
left and right child. Now, here's one way that you could code up this particular
type of binary tree. Instead of thinking in terms of the entire tree, you could
start by coding a TreeNode class where each node instance has a left and a right
child. You could then create the binary tree from the previous slide like this
by specifying all of the individual nodes and then assigning them to be the
child node of the appropriate parent. Well, this works quite well, but the code
isn't the friendliest. Also, more importantly, there's no concept of ordering
nodes. When you insert a node, you just make one node the child of another. The
nice thing that trees give you that linear data structures like a arrays and
linked lists don't is the ability to search if you have chosen an order when you
insert or delete items. Let's modify our tree to make it a searchable one, a BST
or Binary Search Tree. This is where the tree should be modified so that you
don't just blindly add children. You're going to start

Throughout this module, you've been revisiting and exploring different data
types that are used to solve complex problems in programming. In this lesson,
you're going to take a deep dive implementing my favorite data structure the
hash table or the hash map. It's often quite confusing why there are two
different names for effectively the same thing. If you were to ask five
different programmers about this naming convention, you'd probably get ten
different answers so I'm going to give you mine and that is that the language
Java had two different data types, and they're now mostly obsolete that did
roughly the same thing, but had different names, and I believe that led to this
current confusion. You might hear the terms, hash table and hash map being used
interchangeably and if you do, just realize that ultimately there are two terms
for roughly the same thing and that is a data structure that looks and feels
like an array, but where the index can be any value, not just a number. If an
array looks like this, then an equivalent hash table would look like this. Now,
while it's nice to be a bit more readable, this probably isn't the best solution
for tracking home runs of players so let's consider another approach. This one
is a common job interview question. Actually, when I was interviewed at Google,
I was asked this one. Imagine you have all of the works of Shakespeare in a
dataset. Your task is to count the instance of each word, how many times the,
how many times [inaudible], how many ands, and all of that. Now, you could see
how the algorithm would begin to take shape. Say you begin with the Scottish
play the one that the actors won't say the name of because of superstition yeah,
that's the one. It begins like this. The first word is thunder. You could use a
hash table like this to track the occurrences. The next word is and so you could
do this. This suggests a pretty simple algorithm. Go through all the words, and
if it exists

help you fix those bugs. Take your time, work through the code. You'll see that
the implementation has grown far beyond our original binary search tree, and it
looks a lot more like the code that you'd expect to find in a professional
production environment. Once you're done, I'll see you in the next video, where
you'll revisit your next data structure: graphs.

the occurrences. The next word is and so you could do this. This suggests a
pretty simple algorithm. Go through all the words, and if it exists in the hash
table, add one to its value, and if it doesn't, then just create it and set it
to one. If you do that for every word, you'll then have a count of each
individual word in the corpus. Easy, right? The algorithm was easy because the
data structure makes it so. Under the hood, the Python dictionary object uses a
hashing function to turn words like thunder or and into numeric values. If you
were to implement your own hash table, it's important to understand how hashing
functions like that work so that you don't get a conflict. For example, if
you're counting every individual word in Shakespeare and your hashing function
gives the same numeric value for thunder as it does for and, then the counts of
those words would be mushed together. Creating a hashing function is beyond the
scope of this course, but it is something that you want to watch out for as you
make your code production-worthy. Let's explore these types of data structures
and how you can build bigger and better implementations of them with LLMs as
your coding partner. Let's start working with Python and a hashmap to solve a
problem like the word counting example from earlier. I'll start with a prompt.
I'm asking the model to write Python code, where given a URL the script should
download the text at that URL and count every instance of every word and the
model will return something like the Python code that you can see here in count
words.py. What's interesting is that the LLM imports a type called counter from
the library collections. Now, that's something I probably would not have known
unless I was a deep expert in the Python ecosystem, and I would likely have just
dived in and started hand rolling my own code with an iterator like I did
earlier. By the way, this is a good moment to remind you that if the LLM
suggests code that you're

your code easy to follow. Take your time to get it right. It is easy to get into
bad habits of just having code created for you. Always critique what the model
responds with and test to make sure that the code works just the way you want.
And when you're done, I'll see you in the next video.

to deploy professional solutions. >> And do these courses have any
prerequisites? >> I think the only prerequisite here would be it's good to know
a little bit of python. So if you're a Python developer, it's good. We're also
going to touch some other languages like Java and JavaScript, but we'll be
primarily working in Python. >> So lots of things to learn in these courses. And
with that, let's jump into how you can use large language models right away to
help you with your coding. Let's go on to the next video to get started.

Now let's dive into the engine room of modern AI specifically the transformer
architecture. This revolutionary design has become a game changer for natural
language processing. You'll unpack the basics of how transformers work, see how
they've paved the way for the advanced large language models like GPT or Gemini
that have so quickly captured public attention and started to revolutionize what
it looks like to be a software developer. First introduced in the paper,
Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al in 2017. The transformer model
brought a new approach to machine learning models for handling sequences of
information like text. Earlier you saw how supervised learning worked. A
computer learns to predict data that was labeled, and a machine learned to match
the data to the label, like a retina to a doctor's opinion of the state of
disease within that retina. More complex algorithms such as recurrent neural
networks, started to learn about the sequences of data. Now, this was really
useful for models that could predict what would happen next in a system as
opposed to predicting what they see. For text, these could be pretty good, but
they were limited in understanding the deep meaning in text. The big idea behind
transformers is that they process all parts of the data simultaneously. This
parallel processing capability not only speeds up training, but also improves
the ability to handle long range dependencies in text. Now, let's take a look
and see what this means. Consider this sentence. In Ireland, I went to secondary
school, so I had to study blank. How would you finish this sentence? Let's
explore that a little bit. First, secondary school is the equivalent to high
school elsewhere. It's for older children studying more advanced things. Of
course, Ireland is a country, so there may be topics that someone would study in
Ireland, that people in other countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis
on that country in the sentence, instead of just saying,

the technology is and staying with the technology even as it matures, I think
that would be critical for us really doing the best work that we can. >>
Sometimes when we start building a system, we start at the whiteboard and we
start drawing all these boxes and arrows between them and thinking about the
constraints. And given the idea that today we generate code or we generate
documentation, or we generate test cases and other things from a prompt. It
might be very interesting that in the not-too-distant future, those system
specification designs that we draw on boxes on a whiteboard could be the next
prompt. And to be able to design systems off of those with multimodal models now
being able to recognize imagery and being able to parse that kind of thing. That
I can see that going back to that domain expertise, that when you have a domain
expertise to solve a particular problem and you can draw the architecture of
that, that architecture can be implicitly turned into code which would execute.
And you may not even be interfacing that much with raw code, right, unless you
want to tweak and debug. And it's like five years from now, that could be a way
that software developers will be even more effective. And it's something that
I'm looking forward to, that's in the future. But what do we have today? So in
this specialization, so we have three courses. The first thing that we do want
to emphasize that this isn't a series of courses on how to build generative AI.
This is a series of courses on how to use generative AI to be a better software
developer. And the skills that we're looking at building here are really
relevant for you in all areas. As we've touched on a little bit already, it's
not just coding, it's documentation, dependency management, testing, a little
bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your friend. >> So
with these courses, anyone that writes code, we're going to adopt best practices

you sometimes get stuck. You gotta find a human expert to help you get unstuck.
And I really like this analogy of pair programming of you always have a buddy
with you now that you can ask it a question with from right away. And I think
compared to waiting a day or whatever to track down that domain expert, not that
the LLM always knows every answer. But the fact that your buddy can give you an
answer right away, give you some options, I see this helping developers get
unstuck. Not all the time, but at least much more rapidly. >> I found for me
personally, sometimes if it's not helping solve the immediate problem, it sparks
inspiration. Some of the answers that it give will help me find a different
track that I'm going to follow to be able to fix a particular problem or to go a
whole new direction that I hadn't previously thought of. And it's that sparking
of inspiration is one of the things that really can make the task more
enjoyable. >> One of the things I really appreciate about the insights you
brought to our conversations was I think a lot of us have been using generative
AI to help with coding in ad hoc but effective ways. One of the things that I
saw you do that I really appreciated was going through, frankly, a lot of the
tasks that developers have to go through. And then to think through best
practices for how can generative AI help with different tasks? So, for example,
I just had not thought of using generative AI to help with test-driven
development to write tests until I heard about that from you quite a while back
now. But I think those systematic analysis of what are the things you could do,
what are the best practices? I really appreciate your thinking that, putting it
together for us. >> Thank you, thank you. Yeah, and another one in that realm
that I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your

that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.

suffer vision loss before any diagnosis. And this is a tragedy because the
disease is completely preventable. In order to address this doctor shortage,
researchers turned to machine learning. They created a dataset of tens of
thousands of retinal scans that were graded by doctors on a five point scale
from no issues all the way up to advanced disease. Doctors would spot patterns
like hemorrhages, as you can see here. The researchers then used the resulting
data and human assigned labels to train a machine learning algorithm to match
one to the other and carry out the same feature spotting as the doctors. So this
model enables a computer to learn how to diagnose images as well as, and
sometimes even better than, a human. But machine learning can sometimes find
other interesting relationships in the data set. In this case, the retina images
weren't just labeled with disease features, but also other data like the
patient's age, their birth, assigned gender, blood pressure readings and so on.
And because supervised learning matches data to labels, the algorithm here has
learned to match the images to all of the labels, and in the process, reveals
something new. The model was able to correctly predict a person's birth,
assigned gender from the retina image 97% of the time. Somehow it could see this
label in the images in a way that humans cannot. A human will get this right
about 50% of the time, the same odds as flipping a coin. So, supervised learning
is a very powerful technique that can be applied to different kinds of labeled
data, from images to sounds and text. In fact, it's supervised learning using
text data that has led to the development of the powerful large language models
that power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are
trained on vast amounts of text data, where the model learns the relationships
between sequences of words and what naturally follows. Enabling it to predict

So you just saw how machine learning is a paradigm shift that lets a computer
figure out the rules required to complete a task itself based on the data and
answers that you provide. Let's take a closer look at how this works by
considering the problem of activity recognition. Your goal is to write an app
that uses sensors on a phone or a watch or some other device to determine a
person's activity. Are they walking? Are they running? Are they biking or doing
something else? You could, for example, use the device sensor speed data and
write a rule that decides that if the speed is below a certain value, say 4 mph,
then the device wearer is probably walking. You have the data, you have a rule,
you get an answer, and then you can extend this to determine if they are running
by extending the rule. If it's below 4, they're walking, otherwise they're
running, great. It still works, sort of. And you can extend it even further to
see if they're biking. If the speed is below four, they're walking. Otherwise,
if it's below 12, they're running. Otherwise, you can say that the user is
biking. But what about other activities? For example, how could you determine
that the user is golfing? What rule could you write that would differentiate
golfing from walking? Also, by now you've probably realized that the other rules
are also that little bit naive. You can't just go by speed alone. You might run
downhill faster than your bike uphill, for example. So let's go back to this
diagram and think about how machine learning could help you solve that problem.
What if you give a computer the answers and the data and you have it figure out
what the rules are for you? So, for example, it could look like this. You could
have someone wear the device and then carry out a number of activities during
each activity. You could capture the data from the device's sensors. You can
then label the data with something like walking, running, biking and golfing.
Now the problem becomes, can you match

I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your friendly pair program or LLM to
help you through that and has that of dependencies and breaking changes and
those type of things to guide you through that, there's a whole lot more to the
universe of being a developer than just writing code. And I think having that
LLM beside you through all of those tasks is really powerful and fun. Now when
we speak about drudgery and not fun, three years ago I downloaded some open
source code that uses Python 3.12. There's some weird features that I've never
used, and then thank goodness LLM told me how to modify the code to be
compatible with Python 3.10 or whatever I was using. And I think that kind of
thing really saves developers a lot of time. And it does know Python 3.10 and
Python 3.12 much better than I did, and so it could help me solve the problem
quickly. >> Exactly, exactly. So changing tech for a second, we're looking at
all these advancements and all these improvements, and what if we were to cast
our eye down the road of time and think, what do you think software development
will look like in five years with this? I think it's exciting. It feels like
syntax is already becoming less important. So there's one few thing we need to
memorize as much of. And then I think as AI becomes increasingly able to
autonomously write code, test it with agentic workflows, AI can write code, test
it, debug it. I feel like, software developers can operate at a higher and
higher level. I think there'll be plenty of work for us as humans to do to guide
and supervise AI for a long time. But then knowing where the technology is and
staying with the technology even as it matures, I think that would be critical
for us really doing the best work that we can. >> Sometimes when we start

it's not just coding, it's documentation, dependency management, testing, a
little bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your
friend. >> So with these courses, anyone that writes code, we're going to adopt
best practices and using generative AI to help with these. Can you say a bit
more about what the three courses are about? >> Sure, sure, so we kind of broke
the three courses into themes. So the first course is really for you as an
individual software developer. It's going to introduce you a little bit to LLMs
and how you can use them as a pair programmer. But then you're going to get into
prompting and system prompting and having an LLM play roles like software tester
or any of those kind of roles of the type of people that you'd be working
alongside to build better code. The second one then is really when you start
thinking about collaboration with other people as a software engineer. You're
going to work with testers, you're going to work with people who do
documentation, you're going to be working with people who give you dependencies.
They may be internal to your company, or it might be third party dependencies
like Python ones. And we're going to work through the skills of you being able
to use an LLM to just be better at doing all of that. Then in the third and
final course, it's like we're really going to take that to the professional
software developer level where you can understand the full workflow of building
and launching applications from the design phase with design patterns and the
famous gang of four patterns through things like data serialization and database
management. That's really the whole idea of this, to help you start as an
individual developer, go on to working in a team, and then go on to really being
able to deploy professional solutions. >> And do these courses have any
prerequisites? >> I think the only prerequisite here would be it's good to know
a little bit of python. So if you're a Python developer,

to each other in the text. LLMs available to you will have been trained on
almost unfathomably large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This
training allows them both to understand long or nuanced prompts and generate new
text, for example, code that best matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're
excited to start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're going to learn about in the next
module. I'll see you there.

Welcome to Generative AI for Software Development. Generative AI is helping many
software developers write faster, better codes. And just to be clear, this
specialization is not about writing generative AI applications. It's about how
generative AI can help with software development, whether you're data scientists
or front end or backend or full stack of mobile or whatever type of developer.
I'm here with Laurence Moroney, who will be instructor for these courses. You
might be familiar with Laurence from the Tensorflow courses he had taught with
Deep Learn AI some time back. Laurence is also the author of more than 30 books,
some Sci-Fi some programming, many machine learning. And I'm excited to have him
teach best practices for how you can write software better using generative AI.
>> Always delighted to be here, Andrew, and to work alongside you and your team.
So one of the things that I know you've been thinking about is really the impact
of Generative AI on the day to day role of a software developer. And how do you
feel it's going to impact, what's that going to look like? >> The thing that
surprised me was how much more fun coding is with generative AI than without.
Three weeks ago, I was trying to deploy something to cloud service. Hadn't done
it for a while and I'd forgotten how to do it. And I thought, boy, if I had to
go and read that documentation to figure it out, I could have done it. But
frankly, it was much faster to prompt an LLM to guide me through the sense,
which turned out to be almost correct. To help me package up a Docker container,
push to the cloud service they're using, and just get the job done. So I find
myself looking forward to coding more now that I know I have this coding
companion as my generative AI buddy to help me along. >> Yeah, it's those kind
of drudgery tasks sometimes that take away from the joy of solving a particular
problem. And when you have that pair programmer

AI buddy to help me along. >> Yeah, it's those kind of drudgery tasks sometimes
that take away from the joy of solving a particular problem. And when you have
that pair programmer alongside you to help you through those, it does make the
overall task of that offer. >> Yeah, and productivity is one thing, all for
that. I guess there was a McKinsey study, then a Cisco study that estimated
something like 35-ish, maybe more, percentage improvements in productivity boost
for code generation and various tasks. So productivity boost is great, all for
that. But then the fun is a big bonus too. >> Totally. Yeah. It's like I found
myself, I'm sitting down and I'm enjoying coding much more than I had been
previously, because I'm spending more time thinking about the problem that I'm
working on and thinking about how to implement that, solve that problem, as
opposed to what do I do for user interface, what do I do for a docker container
to push to the cloud and those types of things. It's really fun. >> So elephant
in the room, on social media, there have been some very strident voices saying
no one ever needs to write code and software engineers would be obsolete because
of generative AI. I think we share similar view on that. Yeah, I honestly think
that that viewpoint is wrong, and I'll come out and say that because I think
your expertise as a software developer, if anything, is more important than ever
in the age of gender of AI, because it can make you have those superpowers, be
more effective, be able to solve those domain problems and have fun while you're
doing it, so you can have, as we've been sharing, so you can have a more
fulfilling thing and just have a better time at work. >> In fact, one I suspect
will happen is if indeed the estimates of, let's say 35% productivity boosts are
accurate, then I think what will happen is people that use AI will replace
people that don't. But AI won't replace software developers. And when I think
about the studies showing

Let's start your journey by going back to basics and looking at the AI
landscape. I'm assuming if you're taking this course, you're an experienced
developer, but you may not know as much about machine learning or generative AI.
The next few videos will provide a high level overview of the way machine
learning models are trained using data. I'll also explain how one architectural
called a transformer is particularly well suited for powering large language
models. If you already are comfortable with these topics, feel free to scam or
even skip the next few videos in this module. If not, stick with me for a quick
introduction to the key concepts, powering generative AI tools. There are many
definitions of AI, but the one that I prefer is to think of AI as programming a
computer to react to data in the way an intelligent being does. Let's explore
what that means. Here's an image of a cat. You know it's a cat? I know it's a
cat. But how would a computer see this? A computer doesn't really see, and
instead, it would recognize this picture as just a bunch of colored pixels that
have no associated meaning. Whereas you and I would see a cat, and a different
thinking being like a dog would also see it as a cat and probably react by
chasing it or barking at it. But how do living creatures see the cats? We don't
see pixels, but instead we see something like eyes and ears and paws and the
like, and over time, we have learned that when a creature has ears like this and
eyes like this, it's a cat. Does this give us the basis to program a computer to
be artificially intelligent in the way that living creatures are really
intelligent? The answer is, yes. Remember the definition from a few moments ago,
it's that the concept of AI is programming a computer to react to data. If you
can have the computer recognize features in the same way that people or animals
do and learn to put these features together to make an interpretation that what
it's looking at is a cat, then you can say that

countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis on that country in the
sentence, instead of just saying, I had to study. As a human, you paid attention
to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you to predict that
the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the language, and you'll
be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that presented transformers.
Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers are highly
technical, and I'm not going to go into all of the specifics here. That would be
a full course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are
important for you to know. Let's go on to the next video to explore those

something new. The model was able to correctly predict a person's birth,
assigned gender from the retina image 97% of the time. Somehow it could see this
label in the images in a way that humans cannot. A human will get this right
about 50% of the time, the same odds as flipping a coin. So, supervised learning
is a very powerful technique that can be applied to different kinds of labeled
data, from images to sounds and text. In fact, it's supervised learning using
text data that has led to the development of the powerful large language models
that power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are
trained on vast amounts of text data, where the model learns the relationships
between sequences of words and what naturally follows. Enabling it to predict

best practices and using generative AI to help with these. Can you say a bit
more about what the three courses are about? >> Sure, sure, so we kind of broke
the three courses into themes. So the first course is really for you as an
individual software developer. It's going to introduce you a little bit to LLMs
and how you can use them as a pair programmer. But then you're going to get into
prompting and system prompting and having an LLM play roles like software tester
or any of those kind of roles of the type of people that you'd be working
alongside to build better code. The second one then is really when you start
thinking about collaboration with other people as a software engineer. You're
going to work with testers, you're going to work with people who do
documentation, you're going to be working with people who give you dependencies.
They may be internal to your company, or it might be third party dependencies
like Python ones. And we're going to work through the skills of you being able
to use an LLM to just be better at doing all of that. Then in the third and
final course, it's like we're really going to take that to the professional
software developer level where you can understand the full workflow of building
and launching applications from the design phase with design patterns and the
famous gang of four patterns through things like data serialization and database
management. That's really the whole idea of this, to help you start as an
individual developer, go on to working in a team, and then go on to really being
able to deploy professional solutions. >> And do these courses have any

countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis on that country in the
sentence, instead of just saying, I had to study. As a human, you paid attention
to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you to predict that
the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the language, and you'll
be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that presented transformers.
Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers are highly
technical, and I'm not going to go into all of the specifics here. That would be
a full course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are
important for you to know. Let's go on to the next video to explore those

almost unfathomably large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This
training allows them both to understand long or nuanced prompts and generate new
text, for example, code that best matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're
excited to start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're going to learn about in the next

that would be critical for us really doing the best work that we can. >>
Sometimes when we start building a system, we start at the whiteboard and we
start drawing all these boxes and arrows between them and thinking about the
constraints. And given the idea that today we generate code or we generate
documentation, or we generate test cases and other things from a prompt. It
might be very interesting that in the not-too-distant future, those system
specification designs that we draw on boxes on a whiteboard could be the next
prompt. And to be able to design systems off of those with multimodal models now
being able to recognize imagery and being able to parse that kind of thing. That
I can see that going back to that domain expertise, that when you have a domain
expertise to solve a particular problem and you can draw the architecture of
that, that architecture can be implicitly turned into code which would execute.
And you may not even be interfacing that much with raw code, right, unless you
want to tweak and debug. And it's like five years from now, that could be a way
that software developers will be even more effective. And it's something that
I'm looking forward to, that's in the future. But what do we have today? So in
this specialization, so we have three courses. The first thing that we do want
to emphasize that this isn't a series of courses on how to build generative AI.
This is a series of courses on how to use generative AI to be a better software
developer. And the skills that we're looking at building here are really
relevant for you in all areas. As we've touched on a little bit already, it's
not just coding, it's documentation, dependency management, testing, a little
bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your friend. >> So

Welcome to a skills certificate for generative AI for software development. It's
an innovative course designed to empower you with the cutting edge skills
required to integrate and leverage generative artificial intelligence within the
realm of software development. As businesses and technologies evolve, the demand
for advanced AI capabilities is skyrocketing. This course offers you a
comprehensive pathway to not only understand generative AI technologies, but
also to apply them when you create, enhance, and scale software applications. By
the end of this specialization, you'll know how to use generative AI tools to
assist you with all of the major tasks that make up the software developer role,
allowing you to do your work better and more efficiently. You may have heard
about how GenAI can generate code, but you need a lot more than just code to
build a working system. So with this course, you'll see how you can enhance your
coding skills to become a better engineer by having large language models, or
LLMs, at your side to assist you through the process. So let's begin by taking a
step back and exploring LLMs. You might have heard these terms, but what do they
really mean for you as a developer? Let's unpack this and explore the
implications for your projects and workflows. Generative AI refers to artificial
intelligence systems that can generate new content. This includes everything
from code snippets to fully rendered images, and even synthetic media like
videos and music. For instance, you may have encountered tools like GitHub
Copilot. It's a prime example of how generative AI assists in coding by
suggesting entire lines or blocks of code as you type. It's fascinating to see
how deeply AI is integrated into the tools that you use daily. Think about
search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs, and even some debugging tools, all
powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency. Focusing on the generative side, AI

There are two key concepts that form the foundation of how transformers work.
You'll explore those in more detail in this video. The first is attention. In
essence, attention allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input text
when predicting the next word, like you just did with my secondary school
example sentence. Attention considers the relationships between words in a
sentence to understand the context and predict the upcoming word. For example,
if you had a sentence like my little white fluffy dog ran towards my guest, the
attention mechanism would allow for the model to focus on the adjectives,
little, white, and fluffy when predicting the meaning of the noun dog. This
would help the model to understand that the dog is likely to be something that's
greeting my guest and not attacking them. The model might predict and greeted
them enthusiastically as the text that completes the sentence. But how exactly
does this attention mechanism work? Let's take a closer look at how the text is
represented by the model. Text is broken down into pieces called tokens, which
are mostly individual words, but they're occasionally pieces of words. Each word
is assigned a high dimensional vector, which is a mathematical representation of
the words meaning. This vector is called an embedding. The attention mechanism
helps to adjust these embeddings to account for the context of the surrounding
words. For example, here, little, white, and fluffy will impact the values of
the dog vector, changing it to more resemble them. The model then goes through
multiple attention blocks where the embeddings are updated repeatedly. As a
result, details about the words and the sentences are used to learn the
underlying concepts, and with proper tuning, they can very accurately determine
the underlying semantics and thus generate semantically accurate text to follow
a phrase. Overall, the attention mechanism is a powerful tool that allows
transformers to capture

I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your friendly pair program or LLM to
help you through that and has that of dependencies and breaking changes and
those type of things to guide you through that, there's a whole lot more to the
universe of being a developer than just writing code. And I think having that
LLM beside you through all of those tasks is really powerful and fun. Now when
we speak about drudgery and not fun, three years ago I downloaded some open
source code that uses Python 3.12. There's some weird features that I've never
used, and then thank goodness LLM told me how to modify the code to be
compatible with Python 3.10 or whatever I was using. And I think that kind of
thing really saves developers a lot of time. And it does know Python 3.10 and
Python 3.12 much better than I did, and so it could help me solve the problem
quickly. >> Exactly, exactly. So changing tech for a second, we're looking at
all these advancements and all these improvements, and what if we were to cast
our eye down the road of time and think, what do you think software development
will look like in five years with this? I think it's exciting. It feels like
syntax is already becoming less important. So there's one few thing we need to
memorize as much of. And then I think as AI becomes increasingly able to
autonomously write code, test it with agentic workflows, AI can write code, test
it, debug it. I feel like, software developers can operate at a higher and
higher level. I think there'll be plenty of work for us as humans to do to guide
and supervise AI for a long time. But then knowing where the technology is and
staying with the technology even as it matures, I think that would be critical
for us really doing the best work that we can. >> Sometimes when we start

suffer vision loss before any diagnosis. And this is a tragedy because the
disease is completely preventable. In order to address this doctor shortage,
researchers turned to machine learning. They created a dataset of tens of
thousands of retinal scans that were graded by doctors on a five point scale
from no issues all the way up to advanced disease. Doctors would spot patterns
like hemorrhages, as you can see here. The researchers then used the resulting
data and human assigned labels to train a machine learning algorithm to match
one to the other and carry out the same feature spotting as the doctors. So this
model enables a computer to learn how to diagnose images as well as, and
sometimes even better than, a human. But machine learning can sometimes find
other interesting relationships in the data set. In this case, the retina images
weren't just labeled with disease features, but also other data like the
patient's age, their birth, assigned gender, blood pressure readings and so on.
And because supervised learning matches data to labels, the algorithm here has
learned to match the images to all of the labels, and in the process, reveals
something new. The model was able to correctly predict a person's birth,
assigned gender from the retina image 97% of the time. Somehow it could see this
label in the images in a way that humans cannot. A human will get this right
about 50% of the time, the same odds as flipping a coin. So, supervised learning
is a very powerful technique that can be applied to different kinds of labeled

text data that has led to the development of the powerful large language models
that power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are

So you just saw how machine learning is a paradigm shift that lets a computer
figure out the rules required to complete a task itself based on the data and
answers that you provide. Let's take a closer look at how this works by
considering the problem of activity recognition. Your goal is to write an app
that uses sensors on a phone or a watch or some other device to determine a
person's activity. Are they walking? Are they running? Are they biking or doing
something else? You could, for example, use the device sensor speed data and
write a rule that decides that if the speed is below a certain value, say 4 mph,
then the device wearer is probably walking. You have the data, you have a rule,
you get an answer, and then you can extend this to determine if they are running
by extending the rule. If it's below 4, they're walking, otherwise they're
running, great. It still works, sort of. And you can extend it even further to
see if they're biking. If the speed is below four, they're walking. Otherwise,
if it's below 12, they're running. Otherwise, you can say that the user is
biking. But what about other activities? For example, how could you determine
that the user is golfing? What rule could you write that would differentiate
golfing from walking? Also, by now you've probably realized that the other rules
are also that little bit naive. You can't just go by speed alone. You might run
downhill faster than your bike uphill, for example. So let's go back to this
diagram and think about how machine learning could help you solve that problem.
What if you give a computer the answers and the data and you have it figure out
what the rules are for you? So, for example, it could look like this. You could
have someone wear the device and then carry out a number of activities during
each activity. You could capture the data from the device's sensors. You can
then label the data with something like walking, running, biking and golfing.
Now the problem becomes, can you match

that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.

Welcome to Generative AI for Software Development. Generative AI is helping many
software developers write faster, better codes. And just to be clear, this
specialization is not about writing generative AI applications. It's about how
generative AI can help with software development, whether you're data scientists
or front end or backend or full stack of mobile or whatever type of developer.
I'm here with Laurence Moroney, who will be instructor for these courses. You
might be familiar with Laurence from the Tensorflow courses he had taught with
Deep Learn AI some time back. Laurence is also the author of more than 30 books,
some Sci-Fi some programming, many machine learning. And I'm excited to have him
teach best practices for how you can write software better using generative AI.
>> Always delighted to be here, Andrew, and to work alongside you and your team.
So one of the things that I know you've been thinking about is really the impact
of Generative AI on the day to day role of a software developer. And how do you
feel it's going to impact, what's that going to look like? >> The thing that
surprised me was how much more fun coding is with generative AI than without.
Three weeks ago, I was trying to deploy something to cloud service. Hadn't done
it for a while and I'd forgotten how to do it. And I thought, boy, if I had to
go and read that documentation to figure it out, I could have done it. But
frankly, it was much faster to prompt an LLM to guide me through the sense,
which turned out to be almost correct. To help me package up a Docker container,
push to the cloud service they're using, and just get the job done. So I find
myself looking forward to coding more now that I know I have this coding
companion as my generative AI buddy to help me along. >> Yeah, it's those kind
of drudgery tasks sometimes that take away from the joy of solving a particular
problem. And when you have that pair programmer

I hope you've enjoyed this course, and you've come a long way. You started by
looking at what AI is and how machine learning enables you to build artificially
intelligent applications. From there, you looked at how machine learning lets
you do this, exploring the different types of ML. This led to an understanding
of transformers, the technology that underpins generative AI, such as large
language models. One part of generative AI is its ability to generate and
analyze source code, and you explored how to leverage that with many software
engineering tasks beyond just coding from documentation to debugging, and a
whole lot more. You then dug into prompting, and how with a little work on your
prompts, you can get the best out of the model, things like being specific, or
having the LLM adopt a role, or bringing your own expertise to the table to
guide it, providing feedback to help it do better. You then used data structures
as a great example of putting these skills into practice, taking very basic and
fundamental computer science concepts, but stretching them into production
scenarios, understanding how to scale, assess vulnerabilities, limitations in
their implementation, security issues, and a whole lot more. This stuff is also
really useful for software engineering interviews and you're really only getting
started. In this specialization, we'll do a lot more digging into using an LLM
as your assistant to be a much better developer, including using and scaling
data, understanding testing and test cases, and a whole lot more. I'm so excited
to share this journey with you. Thank you.

you sometimes get stuck. You gotta find a human expert to help you get unstuck.
And I really like this analogy of pair programming of you always have a buddy
with you now that you can ask it a question with from right away. And I think
compared to waiting a day or whatever to track down that domain expert, not that
the LLM always knows every answer. But the fact that your buddy can give you an
answer right away, give you some options, I see this helping developers get
unstuck. Not all the time, but at least much more rapidly. >> I found for me
personally, sometimes if it's not helping solve the immediate problem, it sparks
inspiration. Some of the answers that it give will help me find a different
track that I'm going to follow to be able to fix a particular problem or to go a
whole new direction that I hadn't previously thought of. And it's that sparking
of inspiration is one of the things that really can make the task more
enjoyable. >> One of the things I really appreciate about the insights you
brought to our conversations was I think a lot of us have been using generative
AI to help with coding in ad hoc but effective ways. One of the things that I
saw you do that I really appreciated was going through, frankly, a lot of the
tasks that developers have to go through. And then to think through best
practices for how can generative AI help with different tasks? So, for example,
I just had not thought of using generative AI to help with test-driven
development to write tests until I heard about that from you quite a while back
now. But I think those systematic analysis of what are the things you could do,
what are the best practices? I really appreciate your thinking that, putting it
together for us. >> Thank you, thank you. Yeah, and another one in that realm
that I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your

the technology is and staying with the technology even as it matures, I think
that would be critical for us really doing the best work that we can. >>
Sometimes when we start building a system, we start at the whiteboard and we
start drawing all these boxes and arrows between them and thinking about the
constraints. And given the idea that today we generate code or we generate
documentation, or we generate test cases and other things from a prompt. It
might be very interesting that in the not-too-distant future, those system
specification designs that we draw on boxes on a whiteboard could be the next
prompt. And to be able to design systems off of those with multimodal models now
being able to recognize imagery and being able to parse that kind of thing. That
I can see that going back to that domain expertise, that when you have a domain
expertise to solve a particular problem and you can draw the architecture of
that, that architecture can be implicitly turned into code which would execute.
And you may not even be interfacing that much with raw code, right, unless you
want to tweak and debug. And it's like five years from now, that could be a way
that software developers will be even more effective. And it's something that
I'm looking forward to, that's in the future. But what do we have today? So in
this specialization, so we have three courses. The first thing that we do want
to emphasize that this isn't a series of courses on how to build generative AI.
This is a series of courses on how to use generative AI to be a better software
developer. And the skills that we're looking at building here are really
relevant for you in all areas. As we've touched on a little bit already, it's
not just coding, it's documentation, dependency management, testing, a little
bit of architecture, all of that kind of stuff with gen AI as your friend. >> So
with these courses, anyone that writes code, we're going to adopt best practices

power chatbots and other applications. LLMs like ChatGPT, or Gemini are trained
on vast amounts of text data, where the model learns the relationships between
sequences of words and what naturally follows. Enabling it to predict the next
word repeatedly and thus to continue to generate coherent and contextually
relevant text on its own. Well, look at those next. Starting with the
transformer architecture, which makes the generation of text and the artificial
simulation of reasoning possible.

going to touch some other languages like Java and JavaScript, but we'll be

didn't think of them all. This is where an LLMs ability to act as a pair coding
partner comes in really handy. You can ask the LLM to write code to implement a
linked list, and then you can ask the model to talk you through the potential
downsides and overheads. Before walking through what the model has to say, pause
the video again and then try asking an LLM these questions. Once you've done
that, I'll show you how ChatGPT responded to me. Here's ChatGPT's response to my
prompt. As you can see, the model provides details and a long list of potential
issues to consider. I'll be honest, and I'll tell you, I only got four of these
seven items myself. I didn't consider things like cache performance. Again, this
is another good example of how pair programming with an LLM can make you a
better developer. Take a little time to read through the feedback that you get
from the model, and it's just like working with real people; different
conversations will give you different insights. If you think about your own work
with your teammates, different colleagues will often offer different opinions on
how to solve a problem based on their own distinct experiences. In the case of
LLMs, the exact responses will differ based on changing random seeds. But the
overall effect is the same. You can get multiple opinions and insights, use them
to learn more about the fundamentals of your work, and if there's something you
don't fully understand, don't be afraid to ask for clarification or more
explanation. For example, I was curious about the cash performance point here so
I asked for a bit more information. The model responded with a detailed answer,
including some code that could be used to test the hypothesis. Again, take a
moment to pause the video and go back to the conversation you started with the
LLM a moment ago. Choose one of the points that the model raised and ask it to
tell you more. Don't hesitate to ask follow up questions as the model

So you just saw how machine learning is a paradigm shift that lets a computer
figure out the rules required to complete a task itself based on the data and
answers that you provide. Let's take a closer look at how this works by
considering the problem of activity recognition. Your goal is to write an app
that uses sensors on a phone or a watch or some other device to determine a
person's activity. Are they walking? Are they running? Are they biking or doing
something else? You could, for example, use the device sensor speed data and
write a rule that decides that if the speed is below a certain value, say 4 mph,
then the device wearer is probably walking. You have the data, you have a rule,
you get an answer, and then you can extend this to determine if they are running
by extending the rule. If it's below 4, they're walking, otherwise they're
running, great. It still works, sort of. And you can extend it even further to
see if they're biking. If the speed is below four, they're walking. Otherwise,
if it's below 12, they're running. Otherwise, you can say that the user is
biking. But what about other activities? For example, how could you determine
that the user is golfing? What rule could you write that would differentiate
golfing from walking? Also, by now you've probably realized that the other rules
are also that little bit naive. You can't just go by speed alone. You might run
downhill faster than your bike uphill, for example. So let's go back to this
diagram and think about how machine learning could help you solve that problem.
What if you give a computer the answers and the data and you have it figure out
what the rules are for you? So, for example, it could look like this. You could
have someone wear the device and then carry out a number of activities during
each activity. You could capture the data from the device's sensors. You can
then label the data with something like walking, running, biking and golfing.
Now the problem becomes, can you match

find issues in that file, despite my repeated prompting for improvement. Be sure
to share them in the course community pages if you do. By this point, you've
developed a fairly robust solution to a common computer science problem but if
you've been following along, you'll probably know what I'm going to suggest
next. That you look at a piece of code like co text three dot pi and think about
what you would do next. How do you make it even better? I'm going to leave that
part up to you but consider these things that you could do in partnership with
your favored LLM. You could write test cases for the code, maybe trying lots of
different URLs. You could see how it would behave for non-English languages.
Would the regX still work? You could document the code thoroughly, you could
refactor the code to work in a different language. Now, that could be a
programming language or a language that has a different character word set than
English, such as Japanese. There are so many possibilities. I hope this has
inspired you to think about all the ways that you can have long-running
conversations with your LLM of choice, bringing your expertise together with the
models to help you build better code and as I've emphasized throughout this
module, LLMs are a great way to think through the kind of problems you'll have
to solve in coding interviews so please use them as you study.

I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your friendly pair program or LLM to
help you through that and has that of dependencies and breaking changes and
those type of things to guide you through that, there's a whole lot more to the
universe of being a developer than just writing code. And I think having that
LLM beside you through all of those tasks is really powerful and fun. Now when
we speak about drudgery and not fun, three years ago I downloaded some open
source code that uses Python 3.12. There's some weird features that I've never
used, and then thank goodness LLM told me how to modify the code to be
compatible with Python 3.10 or whatever I was using. And I think that kind of
thing really saves developers a lot of time. And it does know Python 3.10 and
Python 3.12 much better than I did, and so it could help me solve the problem
quickly. >> Exactly, exactly. So changing tech for a second, we're looking at
all these advancements and all these improvements, and what if we were to cast
our eye down the road of time and think, what do you think software development
will look like in five years with this? I think it's exciting. It feels like
syntax is already becoming less important. So there's one few thing we need to
memorize as much of. And then I think as AI becomes increasingly able to
autonomously write code, test it with agentic workflows, AI can write code, test
it, debug it. I feel like, software developers can operate at a higher and
higher level. I think there'll be plenty of work for us as humans to do to guide
and supervise AI for a long time. But then knowing where the technology is and
staying with the technology even as it matures, I think that would be critical
for us really doing the best work that we can. >> Sometimes when we start

Throughout this module, you've been revisiting and exploring different data
types that are used to solve complex problems in programming. In this lesson,
you're going to take a deep dive implementing my favorite data structure the
hash table or the hash map. It's often quite confusing why there are two
different names for effectively the same thing. If you were to ask five
different programmers about this naming convention, you'd probably get ten
different answers so I'm going to give you mine and that is that the language
Java had two different data types, and they're now mostly obsolete that did
roughly the same thing, but had different names, and I believe that led to this
current confusion. You might hear the terms, hash table and hash map being used
interchangeably and if you do, just realize that ultimately there are two terms
for roughly the same thing and that is a data structure that looks and feels
like an array, but where the index can be any value, not just a number. If an
array looks like this, then an equivalent hash table would look like this. Now,
while it's nice to be a bit more readable, this probably isn't the best solution
for tracking home runs of players so let's consider another approach. This one
is a common job interview question. Actually, when I was interviewed at Google,
I was asked this one. Imagine you have all of the works of Shakespeare in a
dataset. Your task is to count the instance of each word, how many times the,
how many times [inaudible], how many ands, and all of that. Now, you could see
how the algorithm would begin to take shape. Say you begin with the Scottish
play the one that the actors won't say the name of because of superstition yeah,
that's the one. It begins like this. The first word is thunder. You could use a
hash table like this to track the occurrences. The next word is and so you could
do this. This suggests a pretty simple algorithm. Go through all the words, and

that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.

pause the video and go back to the conversation you started with the LLM a
moment ago. Choose one of the points that the model raised and ask it to tell
you more. Don't hesitate to ask follow up questions as the model goes into
greater depth, and use that back and forth to learn and understand your code and
the underlying problem better so that you can solve your business problems more
effectively. Welcome back. I hope you were able to learn something new from your
chat with the LLM, or at least feel like your own expertise was validated by the
model's responses. I would thoroughly encourage you to get into the habit of
this back and forth when using LLMs to write code. This is the value that you
bring to the table, your experience, your insight, your intellect. Don't fall
into the trap that many people will; the trap of generating code with an LLM,
using it without question, and then moving on without thinking of the deeper
implications. Now, even for a relatively simple structure like a linked list,
there are serious implications that you need to consider if you implement them
in a production environment. Going back to roles, let's ask the LLM to profile
my code, assuming a role like this, an expert software developer at a company
that suffers from denial of service attacks. What risks am I going to face in
this scenario? Let's take a look. The model provides some feedback, that's
scary. Resource exhaustion, slow operations, algorithmic complexity attacks,
memory leak vulnerabilities, concurrency issues. Lots of different risks here
with just this simple data structure. To mitigate these problems, you can ask
the LLM to help you to improve the code, and if you prompt the model with that
request, you'll get some really useful insight from the model on techniques to
make the linked list more secure, like rate limiting, memory management, and a
whole lot more. You'll also get new code that does things like doing input
validation checks, implementing a

I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your friendly pair program or LLM to
help you through that and has that of dependencies and breaking changes and
those type of things to guide you through that, there's a whole lot more to the
universe of being a developer than just writing code. And I think having that
LLM beside you through all of those tasks is really powerful and fun. Now when
we speak about drudgery and not fun, three years ago I downloaded some open
source code that uses Python 3.12. There's some weird features that I've never
used, and then thank goodness LLM told me how to modify the code to be
compatible with Python 3.10 or whatever I was using. And I think that kind of
thing really saves developers a lot of time. And it does know Python 3.10 and
Python 3.12 much better than I did, and so it could help me solve the problem
quickly. >> Exactly, exactly. So changing tech for a second, we're looking at
all these advancements and all these improvements, and what if we were to cast
our eye down the road of time and think, what do you think software development
will look like in five years with this? I think it's exciting. It feels like
syntax is already becoming less important. So there's one few thing we need to
memorize as much of. And then I think as AI becomes increasingly able to
autonomously write code, test it with agentic workflows, AI can write code, test
it, debug it. I feel like, software developers can operate at a higher and
higher level. I think there'll be plenty of work for us as humans to do to guide
and supervise AI for a long time. But then knowing where the technology is and
staying with the technology even as it matures, I think that would be critical
for us really doing the best work that we can. >> Sometimes when we start

counting multiple books, you could have a counter for each and then when you're
done, you could merge them together quite easily. Well, limited by memory and
space, of course, but that's a different problem. Now, thanks to the LM, you can
be more confident about using a counter but the other question was about regular
expressions. Is that really the most efficient and scalable way to find all the
words? Let's ask. From the response, you'll learn that using the base string
methods might be better for this task, but the text has to be relatively clean
and follow a consistent structure. For example, splitting it when there's a lot
of punctuation characters might be very difficult and I think that this would
pretty much come down to and it depends situation where the regGX might be
better for you, depending on your data. Remember, no size fits all and bringing
your expertise about your system to understand the problem is vital. Working
with an LLM like this can throw up some great ideas, but they're not necessarily
always the right ideas for your specific system. Now you've started a basic
algorithm to count the words in a body of work. You started using some basic
libraries in Python, such as counter and regular expressions in order to help.
You've even begun to address the typical follow up question about scaling to
larger problems. In this case, counting word occurrence in all of the works of
the English language and you ended up with code like that in count text2.py,
which is in the repo for this course. Take a look at the code and think about
its vulnerabilities. Other areas there that might be problematic. Pause the
video for a moment and explore the code. What do you think? I tried it with
GPTOmni, and it found six potential issues when I'd only thought of three. The
first is unverified URL inputs. There's no validation or sanitization so how can
you trust that list of URLs? For real solution, you'll have a list that's likely

that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.

It's a common computer science 101 assignment to ask students to implement a
linked list. Nowadays, with LLMs on the scene, you could probably just ask the
model to write the code for you. But this is a very bad habit. It's easy to have
ChatGPT implement code for you, but if you don't understand the code it writes,
or perhaps more importantly, you don't understand why the model decided on a
particular implementation, you can make bad decisions that accumulate technical
debt, which you or a future colleague are going to have to pay off someday. As
you work to write code with an LLM, be sure to quiz the model about why it's
making the recommendations that it does. Anyway, back to linked lists, the idea
of these data structures is to overcome the deficiencies of the arrays that we
just saw, inserting or removing elements, particularly for large arrays is
extremely expensive. With a linked list, instead of the values just being stored
in contiguous memory, items are stored in a place in memory with a pointer to
the position of the next item. Now, if you want to insert a value into the
array, you can put it anywhere in memory and have the pointer from the previous
item point to it, and then have its pointer point to what the previous item had
pointed to before you inserted this one. They're pretty cool, and they give you
the flexibility to insert and delete elements without all of the shifting of
elements around that impairs arrays. It's a pretty cool and useful data
structure. While it fixes some problems with arrays, linked lists have their own
overheads and downsides. Can you see what those might be? Pause the video and
think about this for a bit. There are a few potential issues with this data
structure, and don't worry if you didn't think of them all. This is where an
LLMs ability to act as a pair coding partner comes in really handy. You can ask
the LLM to write code to implement a linked list, and then you can ask the model
to talk you through the potential

In all the videos for this module so far, you've seen how you can work with an
LLM to implement some fundamental data structures, not just the basics from CS
101, but also how you would take these structures into the real world with
considerations for scalability, security, and having them well documented and
tested. Now I'd like you to get hands-on in the graded lab for this course. Your
task will be to implement some important algorithms for working with graphs.
I've provided a graph implementation graph.py, which you can use as your
starting point. Now you're going to have two problems to solve, and for each
you're going to solve it for two cases. First, we'll be with a small graph with
about ten nodes, and then for a large graph with thousands of nodes. The first
problem is given two vertices of a graph. I'd like you to implement an algorithm
to calculate the shortest route between them. One common solution to this is
called Dijkstra's algorithm, and you'll probably learn about others as you chat
with the LLM. The second problem is this, given a starting vertex, calculate the
shortest route to take where you're going to visit all of the vertices in the
graph. A little hint this is commonly called the travelling salesman problem,
and this often shows up in job interviews. Take some time to work on these and
test the code created by ChatGPT thoroughly as you go along. Also, think through
how you're going to make sure that the code is of professional quality and ready
for production, with attributes like security, scalability, manageability, and
so on. The lab will grade your work by running your code on some test cases.
There will also be some hints that you can consult in case you get stuck, and
hopefully the LLM will be a more useful tool as you go through the activity.
When you've completed the lab, I'll see you in the next video to discuss the
final data structure of this module. The hash table.

or something like that. Now, let's see what that looks like. Here's the prompt.
After assigning the role, you can paste the code into the context window for the
model to assess. Here, GPT writes a lengthy response covering necessary stuff
like input validation, error handling, and so on. I'll be honest. I only learned
that Python has a default recursion limit when I read this. It's typically 1,000
calls. A perfectly balanced binary search tree could conceivably hold 2^1,000
values, which is an inconceivably high number. But, of course, the deeper the
tree, the deeper the recursion stack. Again, one could potentially use insert
calls for denial of service attack. You might want to cap the Python recursion
limit. Can you figure out how to do that? I'll leave that as an exercise for
you. Now, having prompted GPT to do the expert and SRE analysis and having
gotten lots of feedback, think about how you would ask it to follow up on that
feedback. Here's a couple of examples that I did. But at this point, you should
be thinking of your own prompts and evaluating the code that comes back. Check
out this video and how I interacted with GPT to continually improve and solidify
the code, and then try it for yourself and see what you can do to improve your
own code. You can find the tree implementation code from this video, which was
created with the assistance of ChatGPT in the downloads for this course. It's
called avl.py. AVL, it's named after the inventors of this type of self-
balancing binary search tree, Georgy Adelson-Velsky, and Evgenii Landis. I hope
I pronounce their names right. Download it, test it out and see if you can break
it. There are some obvious bugs in there, so play with it, and then use an LLM
as your coding companion to help you fix those bugs. Take your time, work
through the code. You'll see that the implementation has grown far beyond our
original binary search tree, and it looks a lot more like the code that you'd
expect to find in a professional

the occurrences. The next word is and so you could do this. This suggests a
pretty simple algorithm. Go through all the words, and if it exists in the hash
table, add one to its value, and if it doesn't, then just create it and set it
to one. If you do that for every word, you'll then have a count of each
individual word in the corpus. Easy, right? The algorithm was easy because the
data structure makes it so. Under the hood, the Python dictionary object uses a
hashing function to turn words like thunder or and into numeric values. If you
were to implement your own hash table, it's important to understand how hashing
functions like that work so that you don't get a conflict. For example, if
you're counting every individual word in Shakespeare and your hashing function
gives the same numeric value for thunder as it does for and, then the counts of
those words would be mushed together. Creating a hashing function is beyond the
scope of this course, but it is something that you want to watch out for as you
make your code production-worthy. Let's explore these types of data structures
and how you can build bigger and better implementations of them with LLMs as
your coding partner. Let's start working with Python and a hashmap to solve a
problem like the word counting example from earlier. I'll start with a prompt.
I'm asking the model to write Python code, where given a URL the script should
download the text at that URL and count every instance of every word and the
model will return something like the Python code that you can see here in count
words.py. What's interesting is that the LLM imports a type called counter from
the library collections. Now, that's something I probably would not have known
unless I was a deep expert in the Python ecosystem, and I would likely have just
dived in and started hand rolling my own code with an iterator like I did
earlier. By the way, this is a good moment to remind you that if the LLM
suggests code that you're

locations, but a specific flight, like the 3:00 PM from Seattle to San Jose, is
a one way connection. If you were building a navigation system with time
sensitivity, you could see where your graph of locations could have both types
of connection. Or more likely, you could have multiple graphs. Graphs are an
incredibly flexible data structure, which, as you can see, can have many uses.
But how do you, as a developer, get the most out of them? Well, let's dive in
and take a look. We'll start with this code that I created using ChatGPT to
implement a directed graph. You can find it in graph.py in the course materials.
You can either use the provided code, of course, or you could write your own.
But what I want you to do next is to look at the code and consider how it might
be used in production. As before, pause the video, think about it a bit, play
with it, and then think through how this implementation might need to be changed
to make it production quality. Take some time with it and then come back when
you're done. Okay, so what did you come up with? For me, the first and most
obvious issue is the fact that the graph only gives a connection between A and
B. But that's not enough information to be useful. For navigation on a map, for
example, one might need distance. For relationships between people, one might
need type. I'm connected to my wife, children and friends, but the type of
connection is much more important between some of them than it is between
others. But the structure doesn't have that. So there are semantic issues that
we need to address. Also consider scalability. If you're using this for
locations with connections between them on a map, there may be many millions of
locations, each with many routes connecting them with other locations. This
thing would have to be able to handle huge amounts of data. And then there's the
underlying implementation. You can see that self.graph is a dictionary, but is
this data type

shift everything else down to create a location to store the new value in. Or if
you want to remove an item from the array, you have to delete the item and then
shift everything else up. In an array with billions of items in it, these moves
aren't feasible, so the idea of a linked list was born. We'll take a closer look
at linked lists in the next video.

with that, let's jump into how you can use large language models right away to
help you with your coding. Let's go on to the next video to get started.

to each other in the text. LLMs available to you will have been trained on
almost unfathomably large datasets of text, including a ton of code. This
training allows them both to understand long or nuanced prompts and generate new
text, for example, code that best matches what you asked for. I'm sure you're
excited to start thinking about how best to use these models in your work as a
software engineer, and that's what you're going to learn about in the next
module. I'll see you there.

Throughout this module, you've been revisiting and exploring different data
types that are used to solve complex problems in programming. In this lesson,
you're going to take a deep dive implementing my favorite data structure the
hash table or the hash map. It's often quite confusing why there are two
different names for effectively the same thing. If you were to ask five
different programmers about this naming convention, you'd probably get ten
different answers so I'm going to give you mine and that is that the language
Java had two different data types, and they're now mostly obsolete that did
roughly the same thing, but had different names, and I believe that led to this
current confusion. You might hear the terms, hash table and hash map being used
interchangeably and if you do, just realize that ultimately there are two terms
for roughly the same thing and that is a data structure that looks and feels
like an array, but where the index can be any value, not just a number. If an
array looks like this, then an equivalent hash table would look like this. Now,
while it's nice to be a bit more readable, this probably isn't the best solution
for tracking home runs of players so let's consider another approach. This one
is a common job interview question. Actually, when I was interviewed at Google,
I was asked this one. Imagine you have all of the works of Shakespeare in a
dataset. Your task is to count the instance of each word, how many times the,
how many times [inaudible], how many ands, and all of that. Now, you could see
how the algorithm would begin to take shape. Say you begin with the Scottish
play the one that the actors won't say the name of because of superstition yeah,
that's the one. It begins like this. The first word is thunder. You could use a
hash table like this to track the occurrences. The next word is and so you could
do this. This suggests a pretty simple algorithm. Go through all the words, and
if it exists

I love is dependency management, right? Because often bugs, there's nothing
wrong with your code, it's just your dependency set, there's something
mismatching in there. And to be able to use your friendly pair program or LLM to
help you through that and has that of dependencies and breaking changes and
those type of things to guide you through that, there's a whole lot more to the
universe of being a developer than just writing code. And I think having that
LLM beside you through all of those tasks is really powerful and fun. Now when
we speak about drudgery and not fun, three years ago I downloaded some open
source code that uses Python 3.12. There's some weird features that I've never
used, and then thank goodness LLM told me how to modify the code to be
compatible with Python 3.10 or whatever I was using. And I think that kind of
thing really saves developers a lot of time. And it does know Python 3.10 and
Python 3.12 much better than I did, and so it could help me solve the problem
quickly. >> Exactly, exactly. So changing tech for a second, we're looking at
all these advancements and all these improvements, and what if we were to cast
our eye down the road of time and think, what do you think software development
will look like in five years with this? I think it's exciting. It feels like
syntax is already becoming less important. So there's one few thing we need to
memorize as much of. And then I think as AI becomes increasingly able to
autonomously write code, test it with agentic workflows, AI can write code, test
it, debug it. I feel like, software developers can operate at a higher and
higher level. I think there'll be plenty of work for us as humans to do to guide
and supervise AI for a long time. But then knowing where the technology is and
staying with the technology even as it matures, I think that would be critical
for us really doing the best work that we can. >> Sometimes when we start
building

your code easy to follow. Take your time to get it right. It is easy to get into
bad habits of just having code created for you. Always critique what the model
responds with and test to make sure that the code works just the way you want.
And when you're done, I'll see you in the next video.

to react to data. If you can have the computer recognize features in the same
way that people or animals do and learn to put these features together to make
an interpretation that what it's looking at is a cat, then you can say that the
computer program is artificially intelligent. But then the question remains,
well, how do you do that? Well, that's where machine learning comes in. Now,
this term may evoke an image like this, but it's not really about robots in a
classroom. It's just a fancy new way of programming a computer. In order to
understand it, let's examine what computer programming really is. Consider the
components that make up traditional software development. For example, you've
likely seen code like this where you read in some data, perform some
manipulation on that data, and return the result. It's what the entire software
industry has been built on, or maybe code like this that specifies the rules
behind how a game will behave. For example, how to move the ball and what
happens when it collides with a brick, et cetera. Traditional programming can be
summarized in a graph like this one, you express rules using code, these rules
act on data, and you get back answers. Think about almost every computer
programming problem and how it can be summarized like this. It's what you've
been doing for your whole career and probably the bulk of what you learned when
you started coding. The machine learning revolution, it's just a new way of
looking at this graph because it's a new and different methodology for coding.
Instead of trying to figure out the rules yourself and express them in code,
what if you give the answers and the data and then have a computer figure out
what the rules are? That's the core of the entire machine learning revolution.
Now, I know this might not make a lot of sense right now if you haven't
encountered machine learning before. Let's move on to the next video to explore
an example in a bit more detail.

AI buddy to help me along. >> Yeah, it's those kind of drudgery tasks sometimes
that take away from the joy of solving a particular problem. And when you have
that pair programmer alongside you to help you through those, it does make the
overall task of that offer. >> Yeah, and productivity is one thing, all for
that. I guess there was a McKinsey study, then a Cisco study that estimated
something like 35-ish, maybe more, percentage improvements in productivity boost
for code generation and various tasks. So productivity boost is great, all for
that. But then the fun is a big bonus too. >> Totally. Yeah. It's like I found
myself, I'm sitting down and I'm enjoying coding much more than I had been
previously, because I'm spending more time thinking about the problem that I'm
working on and thinking about how to implement that, solve that problem, as
opposed to what do I do for user interface, what do I do for a docker container
to push to the cloud and those types of things. It's really fun. >> So elephant
in the room, on social media, there have been some very strident voices saying
no one ever needs to write code and software engineers would be obsolete because
of generative AI. I think we share similar view on that. Yeah, I honestly think
that that viewpoint is wrong, and I'll come out and say that because I think
your expertise as a software developer, if anything, is more important than ever
in the age of gender of AI, because it can make you have those superpowers, be
more effective, be able to solve those domain problems and have fun while you're
doing it, so you can have, as we've been sharing, so you can have a more
fulfilling thing and just have a better time at work. >> In fact, one I suspect
will happen is if indeed the estimates of, let's say 35% productivity boosts are
accurate, then I think what will happen is people that use AI will replace
people that don't. But AI won't replace software developers. And when I think
about the studies showing

countries may not, which is why I put the emphasis on that country in the
sentence, instead of just saying, I had to study. As a human, you paid attention
to those words and the full context of the sentence may lead you to predict that
the blank, the next token is Irish or Gaelic indicating the language, and you'll
be right. That's what gives the title to the paper that presented transformers.
Attention is all you need. Now, the details of transformers are highly
technical, and I'm not going to go into all of the specifics here. That would be
a full course in its own right. But there are two key concepts that I think are
important for you to know. Let's go on to the next video to explore those
concepts.

find issues in that file, despite my repeated prompting for improvement. Be sure
to share them in the course community pages if you do. By this point, you've
developed a fairly robust solution to a common computer science problem but if
you've been following along, you'll probably know what I'm going to suggest
next. That you look at a piece of code like co text three dot pi and think about
what you would do next. How do you make it even better? I'm going to leave that
part up to you but consider these things that you could do in partnership with
your favored LLM. You could write test cases for the code, maybe trying lots of
different URLs. You could see how it would behave for non-English languages.
Would the regX still work? You could document the code thoroughly, you could
refactor the code to work in a different language. Now, that could be a
programming language or a language that has a different character word set than
English, such as Japanese. There are so many possibilities. I hope this has
inspired you to think about all the ways that you can have long-running
conversations with your LLM of choice, bringing your expertise together with the
models to help you build better code and as I've emphasized throughout this
module, LLMs are a great way to think through the kind of problems you'll have
to solve in coding interviews so please use them as you study.

that you use daily. Think about search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs,
and even some debugging tools, all powered by AI, to enhance your efficiency.
Focusing on the generative side, AI can now aid in content creation that goes
beyond traditional data processing. It's about producing new, usable assets from
scratch. Consider something like Dali, which can create images from text
descriptions. Here, I've prompted the model to generate an image of a time
traveling catacorn, half unicorn, half cat, all time traveler. I've included
some features I want the image to have as well, and the model's done a really
good job of creating an image with just those features. Now, this isn't just a
cool toy, it's a glimpse into how you might be soon generating assets for games
or applications directly from a description. So why does this matter? Generative
AI is not just a tool for creating content faster, it's a paradigm shift in how
you can approach problems and solutions in software development. It offers a way
to automate and enhance creativity, reducing the time from concept to product.
Whether you're building enterprise applications or indie games, understanding
generative AI will give you a significant edge. So let's start by exploring just
how all of this works. You're not going to go very deep, but I do think it's
useful for you to see how it works under the hood in order to get the most out
of it.
